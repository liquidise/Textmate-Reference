# Textmate Reference and Cheatsheet

This is an ongoing project to logically and cleanly document a mature usage of TextMate.

Currently, an inital draft of simple 
[TextMate cheat sheet](https://github.com/liquidise/Textmate-Reference/blob/master/Cheatsheet.md) 
is available.

## Next Steps
* Write up a basic philosophy behind the keybindings of shortcuts
* Come up with an explanation of Bundles
* Find a reasonable way to document Snippets
